# How to run the app after cloning:
##### Run this in the directory: 
npm i
##### You might need to run it twice

#### After running npm i, npm will ask you to install expo cli and it will prompt the needed command to install expo cli
##### Now, run: 
expo start
##### This is going to open a tab in your browser.

###### You need to have expo app on your phone for the next step.
###### Scan the serial box with your phone's camera and this will open the expo app and run the app on it.
###### You don't need to run expo every time. After saving most changes, expo will update automatically (just like running a web app)
###### You can also use a phone stimulator on your PC with expo, but I don't recommend it.
